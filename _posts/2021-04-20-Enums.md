## About Enums

This is the first of three posts that will each build on the previous post. Come back next week for the next one!

## So what's an enum?

A distinct type that has a set of named constants.
An enumerator is a data type that has preset values (constants). When we set a variable to an enum value it will always be one of our predefined values

## How do we create an Enum then?

we define an enum a bit like a hash table of values we want to work with, except there is no Name part, its just a set of values.

````powershell
PS> enum Animals {
    Cat
    Dog
    Fish
    Tiger
}
````

## How do we reference an enum once we have created one?

You can reference an enumerator with ```[``` and ```]```

```powershell
PS> [Animals]
```

```powershell
# does that look familiar?
PS> (get-date).dayofweek
PS> (get-date).dayofweek.gettype()
```

We can get a specific item from the enumerator with an index value

```powershell
PS> [Animals].GetEnumName(2)
```

## Using enums as values

Setting a variable to a value and setting a variable to an enum are similar in syntax but subtley different in what implications there are. The first results in a string variable type whereas the other results in a type that is our enum.

```powershell
$var1 = 'fish'
[animals]$Var2 = [Animals]::Fish

$Var1.gettype().fullname
$Var2.gettype().fullname
```

## How do these two variables compare?

```powershell
PS> ($var1 -eq $var2)
```

We can very simply convert our Animals type variable into a string with its built-in ToString() method

```powershell
PS> $var2.tostring()
```

Strange things happen when we add a second value to our [Animals] type variable though

```powershell
PS> $var2 += [Animals]::tiger
PS> $var2
```

The value of our variable has become the sum of the enum object values (Fish is 2 and Tige is 3 in our original declaration of the enum. However, we cant get those values back out very simply. These lines simply return ```False```.

```powershell
PS> $var2 -eq 'fish'
PS> $var2 -eq 'tiger'
```

Trying other comparisons is similarly doomed

```powershell
PS> $var2 -like 'tiger'
PS> $var2 -eq 'fish, tiger'
PS> $var2
```

The value, 5, is also useless to us as both 2+3 and 1+4 could be combinations of values that make up our current value of 5

If we want to work with more than one value in an enum then we need to declare it with the ```[Flags()]``` designation. Looking at the different attributes that a file can have, we could define an enum as follows

```powershell
[Flags()] enum FileAttributes {
    Archive = 1
    Compressed = 2
    Device = 4
    Directory = 8
    Encrypted = 16
    Hidden = 32
}
```

Once that is done we could define ```$file1``` as ```[FileAttribute]```.

```powershell
[FileAttributes]$file1 = [FileAttributes]::Archive
[FileAttributes]$file1 +=[FileAttributes]::Compressed
[FileAttributes]$file1 +=  [FileAttributes]::Device
```

Having done this, we can see the attributes of our imaginary file with this line

```powershell
"file1 attributes are: $file1"
```

Equally, we can use the sum of our selected attribute values to set our variable. Encrypted, Directory, and Device are 16 + 8 + 4 respectively, referencing our declaration above. This totals 28 so we can set our $file2 variable as follows

```powershell
[FileAttributes]$file2 = [FileAttributes]28  
"file2 attributes are: $file2"
```
