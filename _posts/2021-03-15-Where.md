Perhaps one of the most common PowerShell commandlets is [Where-Object](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/where-object) which lets you filter items in the pipeline, preventing unwanted items from the left operator being passed to the right operator.

First we will take a look at strings and delimiters and assignment of values.

Let's create a list of pets

````powershell
    $Pets = "cat,dog,parrot,budgie"
    # all as one string
    $Pets
    # we can split on a given character - note the character gets consumed in the splitting
    $pets -split ','

    # this output is an array so we can ask for specific elements
    ($pets -split ',')[1]
    ($pets -split ',')[0,3]
    ($pets -split ',')[1..3]

    $Mammals = ($pets -split ',')[0..1]
    $Birds = ($pets -split ',')[2..3]
    $ContainA = ($pets -split ',')[0,2]

    $Mammals
    $Birds
    $ContainA
````

````
    # putting that to one side, let's take a look at .Where method
    1..1e2 | set-content C:\temp\file.txt -Force
````
````powershell
    $data = get-content "c:\temp\file.txt"
````
````powershell
    # filtering with the where-object
    $data | where {$_ % 5 -eq 0}
    # similar filter with the where method
    $data.Where({$_ % 5 -eq 0})
````
````powershell
    # advantage ? speed - the .net method is ~50% faster when processing 1M rows

    # but what you dont often encounter are the extras ... What extras?!
    $data.Where
    # "Cannot find an overload for ".Where({ expression } [, mode [, numberToReturn]])" "
    # {expression}
    # [mode] - optional
    # [numbertoreturn] - optional

    # so we know {expression} - we have used that
    # we can assume that numbertoreturn is an integer
    # how do we find the mode values?
    $data|gm -MemberType Method
````

````powershell
    # we have to explore the class
    [where]

    #default
    $MatchedValues = $data.where({$_ -lt 10})
    $MatchedValues

    # the .net methods dont provide output to the pipeline - this is a fundamental difference for .foreach, .where, etc

    # but they dont have to dispose of the objects that dont match the where filter
    $MatchedValues, $NotMatchedValues = $data.where({$_ -eq 10},'split')
    $MatchedValues
    $NotMatchedValues
````

````powershell
    $data = (1..20 )
    $data.where({$_ -eq 10},'until')
    $result, $otherpart = $data.where({$_ -eq 10},'skipuntil')
    $result
    $otherpart
    ````

    $num = 0
    while( $data.count -gt 0){
    Write-Verbose "$($data.count) data rows"
    $num++
    $current, $data = $data.where({$_},"split", 10)
    Write-Verbose "$($data.count) data rows : $($count.count) count rows"
    $current | add-content "C:\temp\file$num.txt" -Force
    }



    $Services = (Get-Service)

    $Services = (Get-Service).where({$_.status -eq "Running"})


    $Services = (Get-Service).where({$_.status -eq "Running"},'split')
