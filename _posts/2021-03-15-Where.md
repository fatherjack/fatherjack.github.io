Perhaps one of the most common PowerShell commandlets is [Where-Object](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/where-object) which lets you filter items in the pipeline, preventing unwanted items from the left operator being passed to the right operator. There are many commadlets that have a similar (in name and functionality) .Net method and in our case this is the [.where](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.where) method. Now the sacrifice we have to make when using .Net methods in PowerShell is that they dont play all that well with the PowerShell pipeline so you need to weigh the benefits of each and decide thoughtfully which to use. Here I will make a case for using the .Net Where method for a specific functionality.

First, some background understanding we will take a look at strings and delimiters and assignment of values.

Let's create a list of pets

````powershell
$Pets = "cat, dog, parrot, budgie"
# this is all one string
$Pets
````

![A list of pets](/images/post_images/img210315_01.jpg)

````powershell
# we can split on a given character - note in the output the character gets consumed in the splitting
$pets -split ','

# this output is an array so we can ask for specific elements
($pets -split ',')[1]
($pets -split ',')[0,3]
($pets -split ',')[1..3]

$Mammals = ($pets -split ',')[0..1]
$Birds = ($pets -split ',')[2..3]
$ContainA = ($pets -split ',')[0,2]

$Mammals
$Birds
$ContainA
````

````powershell
    # putting that to one side, let's take a look at .Where method
    1..1e2 | set-content C:\temp\file.txt -Force

    $data = get-content "c:\temp\file.txt"

    # filtering with the where-object
    $data | where {$_ % 5 -eq 0}
    # similar filter with the where method
    $data.Where({$_ % 5 -eq 0})

    # advantage ? speed - the .net method is ~50% faster when processing 1M rows

    # but what you dont often encounter are the extras ... What extras?!
    $data.Where
    # "Cannot find an overload for ".Where({ expression } [, mode [, numberToReturn]])" "
    # {expression}
    # [mode] - optional
    # [numbertoreturn] - optional

    # so we know {expression} - we have used that
    # we can assume that numbertoreturn is an integer
    # how do we find the mode values?
    $data|gm -MemberType Method
````

Some content between paragraphs of code

````powershell
    # we have to explore the class
    [where]

    #default
    $MatchedValues = $data.where({$_ -lt 10})
    $MatchedValues

    # the .net methods dont provide output to the pipeline - this is a fundamental difference for .foreach, .where, etc

    # but they dont have to dispose of the objects that dont match the where filter
    $MatchedValues, $NotMatchedValues = $data.where({$_ -eq 10},'split')
    $MatchedValues
    $NotMatchedValues
````

````powershell
    $data = (1..20 )
    $data.where({$_ -eq 10},'until')
    $result, $otherpart = $data.where({$_ -eq 10},'skipuntil')
    $result
    $otherpart
````

````powershell
    $num = 0
    while( $data.count -gt 0){
    Write-Verbose "$($data.count) data rows"
    $num++
    $current, $data = $data.where({$_},"split", 10)
    Write-Verbose "$($data.count) data rows : $($count.count) count rows"
    $current | add-content "C:\temp\file$num.txt" -Force
    }



    $Services = (Get-Service)

    $Services = (Get-Service).where({$_.status -eq "Running"})


    $Services = (Get-Service).where({$_.status -eq "Running"},'split')
````
